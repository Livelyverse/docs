From [<mark style="color:purple;">**Lively World**</mark>](lively-world.md#trailer-of-lively-world) program we seek to bring the crypto world closer to small companies, start ups and specially the common people who are not aware of this technology.&#x20;

Our intention is to empower and explain how does the new technological paradigm works and how would this affect our dauly life. Informing viewers about the technological, financial, cryptographic, web 3.0, metaverse and other topics, always oriented from a decentralized technology point of view. We also include travel, interviews with experts of the sector, special interviews and different curiosities related to this world.&#x20;
