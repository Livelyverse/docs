# Asset Manager ERC20

Asset management is very important when distributing tokens according to the tokenomics.

the AssetManagerERC20 can manage distributed tokens safe and secure by asset entity contracts that are compatible, and bind to specific ERC20 token. It substitutes external of accounts (EOA) with smart contracts in the tokens distribution process.
