# ➰ Our Ecosystem

### <mark style="color:purple;">Understanding our ecosystem</mark>

The <mark style="color:purple;">Lively Ecosystem</mark> is a disruptive model that combines the two most important factors of the business world: investment and media. Following a sustainable and competitive guideline, our ecosystem brings to the community a wide range of PR services, investment chances, but specially the experience of being part of this growing entrepreneur world. We aim to provide an opportunity to every start up, from different sectors to help them upgrade in their business.

<mark style="color:purple;">Lively Ecosystem</mark> is composed mainly by an investment side & media side. Integrating key elements of our products which is all connected one to another. Our main core is based on our LVL Token which is our Utility Token. This token can be used for payments for any transactions that can happen in the ecosystem: PR services, marketing campaigns, crowdfundings, staking, rewards…etc. Secondly, this token woild be the engine to power the rest of the features. On the one hand, all the marketing service requests and any utility needs would be covered, redirecting to our Innoverse Decentraliced VC ecosystem structure. Powered by our second token “Inno Token”. This token is mainly based on the financial side and terms. Boosting our investment side, either projects, investors pool, connecting projects with their potential investors.

At the same time, Inno token triggers our third important pilar, which is our DAO system. Covering decision making, governance, portfolio management of the community through DAO governance. Because we want to make all our community part of the project, so everyone is part of Lively and everyone´s voice is heard. However, our community members would receive incentives for being part of a decentralized social media, linking to our social media power on this field, which is Lively World, our own TV show being broadcasted in UCL, talking about latest technological trends and news. Our goal is to spread knowledge in the most fun way to the whole world.

Thanks to Lively World our content will bring viewers & different guests to the show generating user engagement. We aim in the future to build Lively Streaming Platform, the updated Youtube merging the most advanced technologies and allowing access to everyone. What is more, for everyone to make a profit out of it based on views, comments and interaction between all of the members.

Our ecosystem is design with many economic definitions & model behind with its own currency, LVL Token & Inno Token. We offer a strong financial incentives through reward system. Since all the services we offer have a strong impact on the real world, our profit will come from offering the marketplace where business come true.&#x20;
